Code listings from my Scalabook http://scala.obraun.net/, chapters 2 to 7.

Since not all listings contain working code, I have put all of them in .txt-files.

In Chapter 1 there is no listing and chapters 8 to 11 are available from:

* https://github.com/obcode/moviestore_testframeworks
* https://github.com/obcode/talkallocator_lift
* https://github.com/obcode/finalgradecalculator_scalatra
* https://github.com/obcode/moviestore_akka
